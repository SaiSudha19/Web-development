statically typed language vs dynamically typed languages
-some langunagaes are compiled and some are interpreted
-if we do step compilation and we check data type and we got error before the run time is statically typed
-static are more stronger than dyanamic 
-ex : cpp,java
-languages where data type checking can be happen at the compile time stage that is known as statically language
-interpretted languages are dynamically typed as there is no compilation stage and no data types
-we can change the data type in dynamically language
